<p class="lead">Well, it's official! This September I'm leaving my Web Developer job at Places for People and studying two days a week at Valley Academy!</p>

I've had an incredible four years there and learnt so much about programming and I wouldn't change any of it. I'm so glad I got to work on [Cirrus](http://cirruscomplaints.net) and other amazing projects like it. But now, the future holds something incredible! I'm excited for all that God's got in store for me, my wife and Valley Church together. Bring it on!
