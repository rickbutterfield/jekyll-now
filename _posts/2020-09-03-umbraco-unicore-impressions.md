On Thursday 3rd September, Umbraco HQ announced the first alpha of Unicore, Umbraco v8 running on .NET Core.

## What is Unicore?
Unicore is Umbraco's project to get the CMS running on .NET Core. As mentioned in the live stream, the first commits happened in November last year, and they reckon they're about half way through the project as a whole.
- Umbraco 8 running on .NET Core
- HQ working on it since last November

## Why .NET Core?
- Core is the future of .NET
- .NET Framework stops at v4
- Will be renamed to _just_ .NET in November to remove confusion
- Can run on more than just Microsoft technology

## First impressions
- Running on my Mac
- Installer
- Backoffice
- Speed
- What's not there yet (packages, front end)

## What's next
- Test it!
- More alphas
- Up for grabs tasks
- Beta
