<p class="lead">This past Friday, I got chance to go to Mozilla's <a href="https://viewsourceconf.org">View Source Conference</a>&mdash;thanks to winning a ticket at <a href="https://frontendne.co.uk">Frontend NE</a>!</p>

I travelled down to London on the Thursday and did some touristy things first of all. I visited the Tate Modern for the first time in 9 years(!) and also went and did a bit of shopping. Then on Friday morning I headed over to [The RSA](https://www.thersa.org/) for the one day, single-track conference.

And what a day it was! I loved a lot of the sessions, especially those from [Saron Yitbarek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bMXHg7w8mo&t=315s) (pictured above) and one of my developer heroes, [Jen Simmons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20QKda7IhJQ).

You can check out all the notes I took and watch all the videos [over on Notion](https://www.notion.so/rickbutterfield/20181026-View-Source-Conference-9c51f787c15749eaacc1354580528b55).
