<p class="lead">For the first time ever, I got a phone on launch day.</p>

I wasn't planning on upgrading from my OnePlus 5 but all of the talk about how great the Pixel 3 was made me change my mind rather drastically! I **LOVE** Google phones, having had a string of Nexus devices before the Pixel line launched&mdash;the Galaxy Nexus, Nexus 5 and Nexus 6P.
