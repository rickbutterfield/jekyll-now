    <h2>Hey there!</h2>
    <p class="lead">I'm Rick, and I'm a full stack UI developer living in the North West of the UK.</p>

    <p>I'm currently remote working as a senior front end developer for <a href="https://shoutdigital.com">Shout Digital</a> where I get to build websites and software, as well as playing with emerging technologies. This means I'm working mostly with front end tech&mdash;HTML, CSS/Sass, JS/Angular/React and Node&mdash;but I also get chance to do C# .NET, SQL, Umbraco and Sitecore.</p>

    <p>I'm an <a href="https://umbraco.com/training/certified-developers/developer/?id=f0b28dd2-8bee-42c5-9184-b2227b25b99c" target="_blank">Umbraco Certified Developer</a>, and previously I've worked for <a href="http://fatmedia.co.uk">Fat Media</a> and <a href="https://placesforpeople.co.uk">Places for People</a>.</p>

    <p>This site is a little bit of a playground for me to use for front end tech, so have a look around!</p>
