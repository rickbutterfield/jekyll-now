<h2>Hey there!</h2>
<p class="lead">I'm Rick, and I'm a full stack developer living in the North East of the UK.</p>

<p>I'm currently working as a developer for <a href="https://shoutdigital.com">Shout Digital</a> where I get to build websites and software, as well as playing with emerging technologies. This means I'm mainly working with front end tech but I also get chance to work with C# .NET, SQL, Umbraco and Sitecore.</p>

<p>Previously I've worked for <a href="http://fatmedia.co.uk">Fat Media</a> and <a href="https://placesforpeople.co.uk">Places for People</a>.</p>
